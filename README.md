Invoice Data Extraction System
This project aims to automate the extraction of data from invoice images using a combination of YOLOv8 for object detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction. 
The system can identify specific fields such as invoice ID, total amount, address, etc., and convert the extracted information into an Excel sheet with appropriate headings.
